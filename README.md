# Game of Life

This is a Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Pygame. 
Inspired by https://github.com/educ8s/Python-Game-Of-Life-with-Pygame. The
folders contain the code for the different steps of the development. 

The code requires pygame to be installed. If needed install it using

`pip install pygame`
