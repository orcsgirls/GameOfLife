# Python Game Of Life with Pygame
## Game of Life - Fancy version (MVC pattern)

Fancy version of the Game of Life. This was rewritten to more conform to the
Model-View-Controller programming pattern. The classes were renamed to *Model*, 
*View* and *Controller* for clarity. 

Additional feature - the window can be resized and will adjust the cell size.
